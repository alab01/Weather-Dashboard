# Weather-Dashboard

## The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard. The app is made for travlers that are planning a trip, and want to see the weeather outlook for multiple cities. The user can search for any city in the search bar and when they click search they will get the the current weather for that city and the 5 day forecast. Each searched city will be stored in local storage, and will be saved under the search bar with a button for each city. The forecast will display the day, temperature, humidty, wind speed, and UV index. If a user wants to go back to a previously searched city, they can click on the past search cities buttons under the search bar. 

## Technologies Used: html, css, and java script
